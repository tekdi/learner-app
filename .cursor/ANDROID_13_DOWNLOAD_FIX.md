# Android Downloads Fix for All Versions (8-15)

## Problem Identified

The download functionality needed to save images to the **Downloads folder** on all Android versions (8-15) while avoiding Google Play Store permission warnings.

**Additional Issue:** On Android 13+, `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission is blocked by default, but the download should still proceed using an alternative approach.

## Requirements

1. **Images must be visible in Downloads folder** on all Android versions
2. **No broad media permissions** to avoid Google Play Store warnings
3. **Works on all API levels** (26-35)
4. **User-friendly** - files should be easily accessible
5. **Handles blocked permissions** on Android 13+ gracefully

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Permission Strategy

**Android 8-12 (API 26-32):**

- Uses `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission
- Direct download to Downloads folder
- Traditional permission flow

**Android 13+ (API 33-35):**

- Tries to use `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission first
- If blocked, proceeds with alternative approach without stopping
- Downloads to app's external files first, then copies to Downloads

### 2. Permission Handling Fix

**Key Fix:** When permission is blocked on Android 13+, the app now:

1. Returns `true` from permission check (allows download to proceed)
2. Uses alternative download approach
3. Shows success message after completion

```javascript
case RESULTS.BLOCKED:
  if (Platform.Version >= 33) {
    console.log('Android 13+ with blocked permission - will use alternative approach');
    return true; // Allow download to proceed
  } else {
    // Show settings dialog for older Android versions
    return false;
  }
```

### 3. Download Process

**Android 8-12:**

1. Request `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission
2. Download directly to Downloads folder
3. Show success message

**Android 13+:**

1. Try to request `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission
2. If granted: Download directly to Downloads folder
3. If blocked: Download to app's external files, then copy to Downloads
4. Clean up temporary files
5. Show success message

## Testing

### Expected Console Output for Android 13+ (Blocked Permission)

```
